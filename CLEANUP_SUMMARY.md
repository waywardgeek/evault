# Security Cleanup Summary - UPDATED

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED ACTIONS

### 1. Removed Debug/Test Endpoints (HIGH PRIORITY)
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/debug/session/` - Was exposing session tokens!
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/debug-env/` - Was exposing environment config
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/debug-apple/` - Apple auth debugging
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/debug-apple-config/` - Apple configuration
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/oauth-log/` - OAuth logging endpoint
- ‚ùå DELETED All `/api/test-*` endpoints
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/auth/test/`
- ‚ùå DELETED `/api/apple-diagnostic/`

### 2. Removed Test Pages
- ‚ùå DELETED `/test-auth` page
- ‚ùå DELETED `/debug` page

### 3. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Console Logging Cleanup
- ‚úÖ Replaced ALL 145+ console.log statements with environment-aware logger
- ‚úÖ Created logger utility that only outputs in development mode
- ‚úÖ Maintains error logging for debugging while reducing production noise
- ‚úÖ Fixed duplicate imports across multiple files

### 4. ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Rate Limiting Implementation
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive rate limiting system
- ‚úÖ Applied different limits for different endpoint types:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 requests per 15 minutes (strict)
  - Vault operations: 10 requests per minute (moderate)
  - Entry operations: 30 requests per minute (lenient)
  - General API: 100 requests per minute (standard)
- ‚úÖ Added proper HTTP 429 responses with retry headers
- ‚úÖ In-memory rate limiting with automatic cleanup
- ‚úÖ Applied to critical auth and vault endpoints

### 5. Organized Files
- ‚úÖ Moved `test-api-routes.ts` to `scripts/` directory

## ‚ö†Ô∏è REMAINING TASKS (Lower Priority)

### 1. Security Headers
- Add CORS configuration for production
- Add Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Add other security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

### 2. Error Handling
- Review error messages to avoid information disclosure
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components

### 3. Environment Variables
- Make JWT expiration configurable via environment variables
- Review all hardcoded values for configurability

### 4. Additional Rate Limiting
- Apply rate limiting to remaining API endpoints
- Consider implementing per-user rate limiting (requires Redis/database)

## üéØ SECURITY STATUS: SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED

### Critical Issues: ‚úÖ RESOLVED
- No more debug endpoints exposing sensitive data
- No more verbose logging in production
- Rate limiting prevents API abuse

### Remaining Items: Low to Medium Priority
- Security headers (best practice)
- Error message sanitization (information disclosure prevention)
- Configuration improvements (operational)

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS (Optional)

1. Add security headers middleware
2. Review and sanitize error messages
3. Make more values configurable
4. Set up proper logging service for production monitoring
5. Consider implementing Redis-based rate limiting for scale

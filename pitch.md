Have you heard of Apple's Advance Data Protection?  Everyone should enable it, but there's this scary step where they say to print out a recovery code and save it in a safe place, because without it, you can lose your data.  That's where eValutApp.com comes in.  We turn your iPhone PIN into a secure encryption key that protects your data from Apple, hackers, and even governments like the UK who try to force big tech companies to hand over your data.  We leverage a distributed trust network of volunteers from OpenADP.org, which is Open source Advanced Data Protection for everyone.  We want people to stop being afraid, and protect their online data, securely, reliably, and with a simple PIN they will never forget.  We need a landing page that welcomes folks and encourages them to take the next step, to protect their online data with eVaultApp.com.

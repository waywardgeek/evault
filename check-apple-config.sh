# Test recommendations
echo "6Ô∏è‚É£ Debugging Steps:"
echo ""
echo "   1. Try creating a NEW Service ID:"
echo "      - Create com.evaultapp.web2"
echo "      - Associate with primary App ID"
echo "      - Configure domain and return URL"
echo "      - Update APPLE_ID in environment"
echo "      - Regenerate JWT with new Service ID"
echo ""
echo "   2. Try with a fresh key:"
echo "      - Create new key in Apple Developer"
echo "      - Download the .p8 file"
echo "      - Generate new JWT"
echo "      - Update APPLE_SECRET"
echo ""
echo "   3. Verify Primary App ID association:"
echo "      - The Service ID MUST be linked to an App ID"
echo "      - This is often missed and causes invalid_client"

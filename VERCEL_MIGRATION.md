# Migration Guide: Google Cloud to Vercel

## Overview

This guide walks through migrating eVault from Google Cloud (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL) to a Vercel-only solution.

## What's Changed

### Before (Google Cloud Architecture)
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Vercel
- **Backend**: Go server on Cloud Run
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Cloud SQL
- **Complexity**: 2 separate deployments, 2 languages, Docker builds

### After (Vercel-Only Architecture)
- **Frontend**: Next.js on Vercel
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes on Vercel
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres (powered by Neon)
- **Simplicity**: 1 deployment, 1 language (TypeScript), no Docker

## Migration Steps

### 1. Set Up Vercel Postgres

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to the "Storage" tab
3. Click "Create Database" â†’ Select "Postgres"
4. Choose your plan (Hobby is fine for starting)
5. Connect it to your project

Vercel will automatically add these environment variables:
- `POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL` (for connection pooling)
- `POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING` (for migrations)

### 2. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd client

# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# Optional: If you have existing data to migrate
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Add Additional Environment Variables

In your Vercel project settings, add:

```
JWT_SECRET=<generate-a-secure-random-string>
```

### 4. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Commit all changes
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate from Google Cloud to Vercel"

# Push to trigger deployment
git push
```

### 5. Update Frontend Configuration

The API client has been updated to use `/api` instead of the external Go server URL. No additional changes needed.

### 6. Verify Everything Works

1. Test authentication (Google & Apple Sign In)
2. Test vault operations (register, recover)
3. Test entry operations (add, list, delete)
4. Check user account management

## Benefits of This Migration

### 1. **Cost Savings**
- No Cloud Run costs
- No Cloud SQL costs (~$10-15/month minimum)
- No cross-cloud egress fees
- Vercel Postgres starts at $15/month

### 2. **Performance**
- API and database in same network (lower latency)
- No cold starts (unlike Cloud Run)
- Edge functions available
- Better caching with Vercel's CDN

### 3. **Developer Experience**
- Single codebase (TypeScript only)
- No Docker builds
- Instant preview deployments
- Unified logging and monitoring

### 4. **Maintenance**
- No Go server to maintain
- Automatic SSL certificates
- Database backups handled by Vercel
- One dashboard for everything

## API Endpoint Mapping

All endpoints remain the same, just served by Next.js instead of Go:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/auth/callback` | OAuth callback handling |
| `GET /api/user` | Get current user |
| `GET /api/user/info` | Get user details |
| `POST /api/user/refresh` | Refresh JWT token |
| `POST /api/user/update-email` | Update email |
| `DELETE /api/user/delete` | Delete account |
| `POST /api/vault/register` | Register vault |
| `POST /api/vault/recover` | Recover vault |
| `POST /api/vault/refresh` | Refresh metadata |
| `GET /api/vault/status` | Get vault status |
| `POST /api/entries` | Add entry |
| `GET /api/entries` | Get all entries |
| `GET /api/entries/list` | List entry names |
| `DELETE /api/entries` | Delete entry |
| `GET /api/stats` | User statistics |

## Cleanup

After successful migration:

1. Delete Cloud Run service
2. Delete Cloud SQL instance
3. Remove Google Cloud service account
4. Delete the `server/` directory from your repo
5. Update any CI/CD pipelines

## Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure Vercel Postgres is properly connected to your project
- Check that environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Use `npx prisma studio` locally to inspect data

### Authentication Issues
- JWT_SECRET must match between local and production
- Ensure NextAuth is properly configured
- Check that OAuth callbacks are updated

### Performance Issues
- Enable Edge Runtime for API routes if needed
- Use Vercel Analytics to identify bottlenecks
- Consider upgrading Vercel plan for more resources
